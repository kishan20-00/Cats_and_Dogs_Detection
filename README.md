<h1>Cats and Dogs detection through images</h1>

<p>This project is done with the help of Neural Networks. The file <b>"Cats_and_Dogs_Detection"</b> is based on importing packages, Data preprocessing, Defining the model, Compiling the model, running the model and testing the accuracy. But in that colab file the accuracy was 1.0000, which means the model has started to overfit. Overfitting means memorizing the patterns in data which gives a best performance with the training data only. But, only when we start to run the testing data, we can understand the it has a poor performance with the validation set. So, that's why the second notebook is attached which is named as <b>"Cats_and_Dogs_with_Augmentation"</b></p>
<break/>

<p>The second notebook shows the way to prevent overfitting and to improve the performance with the validation set. Some of those techniques are:
<ul style="list-style-type:disc"><li>Image Augmentation</li>
    <li>Early Stopping</li>
    <li>Dropout</li>
</ul></p>
